<div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 10px;"><img src="Trinity-Photo.jpg" alt="Image" height="300" width="420"><br> <em>Photo courtesy of Trinity University</em> </div><p><br><br><a style="color:red;" href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is a private liberal arts university located in San Antonio, Texas. Founded on April 20, 1869, Trinity University has steadily grown into one of the most respectable liberal arts institutions in the country. For several years, Trinity has been considered one of the best regional schools in the west for its rigorous and diverse coursework that spans countless disciples. Recently, U.S. News & World Report ranked trinity University #1 in the Western part of the United States among regional colleges.<br>
<br>Before I came to Trinity University, I had seen beautiful pictures online of what the school looked like, but they do not do the school justice. From the red brick buildings and state-of-the-art facilities to the beautiful oak trees and campus grounds, Trinity is one of the most stunning campuses in the country. Although the school does not have a national reputation of schools like Rice University, Trinity is a unique place in an amazing city with a plethora of amazing opportunities to choose from. These opportunities include the ability to study abroad, use equipment typically reserved for engineering students through the Makerspace, Student Government, and so many more. Although I want to major in physics, Trinity encourages students to explore other disciples, which I found highly enticing. This is what convinced me to transfer to Trinity.<br>
</p>
<p>Some of my favorite features of Trinity University are the small class sizes and the school’s interdisciplinary focus. With small class sizes, I can truly get to know your professors and receive more attention in classes that you are struggling with. At my last school, Alvin Community College, this was my favorite part about my experience at that school. I managed to form close relationships with several of my professors and I now view several of them as mentors. That is possible here at Trinity because of those small class sizes. Additionally, I love the school’s focus on making Trinity students as well rounded as possible by making them explore other disciplines. For example, I was not required to take the class Public Speaking for my major, but, because of Trinity Pathways, I needed to take a class that would fulfill my oral and visual requirement for my core curriculum. I have thoroughly enjoyed the class this semester and found a new activity that I might try to participate in during my time at Trinity: Debate.

<p>All of these things had a substantial impact on my decision to attend Trinity, but the Entrepreneurship program was the key factor that ultimately convinced me to go to this school. Although I had never taken a single business course, entrepreneurship excited me. I have always loved telling stories, innovating, and creating something out of nothing, which is why I think me and entrepreneurship make a pretty good pair. I look forward to continuing in the program over the next few years.
</p>
<p>Ultimately, I plan on majoring in Physics and minoring in Entrepreneurship, but I am not sure what I want to do with either of those yet. I am considering going to medical school, possibly anesthesiology, since i am already half-way through with the prerequisites. I am also looking into the field of medical physics, as well as the potential of pursuing a PhD in physics. However, in a perfect world, I would be the CEO of a company I created. With the skills I will gain through the entrepreneurship program and the experiences I will gain over the next few years at Trinity, hopefully I can make that dream a reality.
Here are some links to the two programs that i plan on being heavily involved with going forward:<br>
